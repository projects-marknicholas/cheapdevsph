While some software development trends announced in 2022 remain unchanged, others spring up unexpectedly and completely change the way businesses work.\r\n\r\nIn this article, we’ve looked into the global software development tendencies together with the world Tech leading companies and outlined the main technology trends for 2023.\r\n\r\n<strong>Adoption of Low Code/No Code Development</strong>\r\n\r\nLow-code development is expected to become one of the main trends of 2023 in software development. Forbes states that “organisations simply cannot spend years trying to get their IT shops in order so that they can compete.” Meanwhile, anyone with a basic knowledge of programming can now try to create their own apps, and for SMEs, this opportunity is especially valuable.\r\n\r\nWhile low-code/no-code solutions are quickly gaining popularity due to their speed and the possibility for any business to enter the market quickly, they are hardly scalable and adjustable if the market trends change and businesses have to react accordingly. Therefore, the demand for custom software development services will still be the most appreciated option.\r\n\r\n<strong>Cloud Computing Is Still On The Rise</strong>\r\n\r\nMost businesses decide to move their applications and systems to the cloud due to their easier infrastructure setup and management, effective and secure data storage, maintenance and support. IaaS and PaaS solutions will continue growing in popularity as they help to easily adopt and deploy software solutions as well as they help cut down development and maintenance costs.\r\n\r\n<strong>Internet of Behaviour</strong>\r\n\r\nInternet of Behaviour (IoB) is the next logical step in the development of IoT technology. Using IoT combined with Big Data, Business Intelligence, and customer data platforms, IoB collects a wide range of information on customer behaviour, their interests and preferences. This allows companies to improve their products from the perspective of human psychology as well as develop and adopt more precise marketing strategies.\r\n\r\nIoB goes further than just influencing buyers’ choices, it’s about creating a more advanced customer experience. This way, companies will be able to create applications that better understand their users’ needs, providing a unified and cohesive experience and making the development solution more relevant and useful.\r\n\r\n<strong>The Rise of Web 3.0</strong>\r\n\r\nWeb 3.0 is a complex notion that implies the usage of the latest Tech advancements when building digital solutions. These advancements can include the development of decentralised applications, implementation of Blockchain, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Big Data technology, 5G and 6G technologies, and many others. The use of these technologies results in a data-driven approach to customer satisfaction.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the global society is at the transition stage from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0. Businesses only partially use decentralised databases and implement AI in their digital solutions. However, it’s clear that in the near future, it’ll be impossible for businesses to compete without leveraging these technologies in their mobile and web applications.\r\n\r\n<strong>Blockchain is Gaining Momentum</strong>\r\n\r\nFor the past decade Blockchain technology has been used to develop secure and reliable digital solutions in healthcare, government, banking, gambling, logistics, and other industries.\r\n\r\nWhile enhancing security, the blockchain solutions also provide transparency of all operations as well as introduce smart contracts to automate processes and improve trust between partners.\r\n\r\nBlockchain technology shows unprecedented growth rates. It’s expected that its global market share will reach $19 bln by 2024 whereas in 2021 it reached $6.6 bln.', '636539bb9bd659.00294700.jpg', '', '', '25 Oct, 2022', '1'),
(3, 'Top Programming Languages for Blockchain App Development', 'Blockchain revolutionizes the way companies do business regardless of their industry. Companies that operate in healthcare, logistics, energy and utilities, FinTech, and many other niches seek opportunities to enhance their workflow efficiency and make their operations more transparent, secure, and fast with the Blockchain technology.\r\n\r\nWhile Blockchain seems to be a lifesaver in a highly-competitive market for many companies, a wide range of them doubt which programming languages to use to build their apps. In this article, we’ll have a look at a variety of programming languages used to develop Blockchain apps and find out which one is the best.\r\n\r\n<strong>Top 10 Programming Languages for Blockchain Development</strong>\r\n\r\nA well-chosen tech stack is a key to success in any software development project. However, when it comes to selecting a tech stack for Blockchain solutions, companies encounter a great diversity of programming languages suitable for various development purposes. So, how to choose the right programming language to create a Blockchain solution?\r\n\r\n<i>Here is the list of the top 10 programming languages that software developers opt for in their projects.</i>\r\n\r\n<strong>1. C++</strong>\r\n\r\nC++ is a performant, general-purpose programming language that is used for building diverse software, including Blockchain solutions. Such systems as Bitcoin, Litecoin, EOS, Ripple, and many others are written in C++.\r\n\r\nOne of the main C++ benefits is that it’s an object-oriented solution that provides access to low-level functionalities. This means that being object-oriented (OOP) C++ significantly facilitates and speeds up the software development process, meanwhile, it’s easily compatible with C and, therefore, can be used for low-level coding which is close to machine code instructions. This makes C++ apps extremely fast and simple to scale.\r\n\r\nBlockchain developers opt for C++ as they can use a variety of programming OOP methods, including primitive control over memory, advanced approach in multi-threading, runtime polymorphism, and others. This helps software developers mix the data the way they like, creating complex and powerful solutions.\r\n\r\n<strong>2. Python</strong>\r\n\r\nPython has gained popularity in the Tech world for its simplified, close-to-natural language syntax. Although this programming language is a comparatively new solution for Blockchain, it’s been implemented for building various networks such as Ethereum, Steem, NEO, QTUM, and others.\r\n\r\nSome Blockchain developers opt for Python as it allows quick prototyping of new ideas and it has an extensive library of various resources such as own and external libraries, plugins, and frameworks. All of them are open-source which means that there is a simple and quick solution to almost every Blockchain development issue.\r\n\r\n<strong>3. Java</strong>\r\n\r\nJava is one of the main C++ competitors by popularity and comprehensive approach to software development. Many prominent Blockchain solutions were developed with Java, including Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, IOTA, NEO, and many others.\r\n\r\nThe most useful features Blockchain developers like in Java are API, OOP, and Portability. These three features allow the building of well-structured, performant applications that can be simply integrated with other digital solutions and run on practically any platform and device. Another Java advantage is its secure interface. This programming language effectively reduces any security threats with the help of its security manager, its sandbox known as Java Virtual Machine, and byte-code verifier checks.\r\n\r\n<strong>5. Ruby</strong>\r\n\r\nRudy is a great choice for those who want to develop a Blockchain solution quickly. Combined with the Ruby on Rails framework, it’s believed to be one of the most time-efficient solutions in the software development market. Software developers choose Ruby for its memory allocation capabilities, simplicity, developer-friendly environment, and cross-platform support.\r\n\r\nThis programming language has a strong and supportive community. Software developers can find a wide range of step-by-step tutorials on Blockchain development with Ruby, including guides on how to build distributed ledger systems from scratch, books on how to create Smart Contracts, tutorials on programming Bitcoin Script Transactions, and many others.\r\n\r\n<strong>6. Golang</strong>\r\n\r\nGolang, also known as GO language, suits well for building quick and efficient Blockchain solutions. With Golang software developers can create multi-threaded applications that efficiently use computing resources which is a must for effective Blockchain operation.\r\n\r\nApart from the multithreading feature, software developers opt for Golang as it’s a compiled and statically-typed language. This protects Golang apps from many runtime errors and ensures a much smoother development experience.\r\n\r\nAnother Golang advantage is that it compiles directly to machine code instead of using any virtual machines. As a result, it reaches nearly a C++ level of performance. Meanwhile, Golang incorporates various coding practices from other programming languages, which makes its code much simpler and less verbose to write.\r\n\r\n<strong>7. C#</strong>\r\n\r\nC# is a powerful OOP solution that is syntactically close to C++ and Java. This makes it an ideal option for Blockchain development. The most popular solutions built with C# include Straits, NEO, IOTA, and a Blockchain-as-a-Service that allows building apps on distributed ledger platforms.\r\n\r\nWhy do Blockchain developers use C# in their work? There are many reasons for that. It offers a wide range of development tools and has a robust .NET Framework for building enterprise-level solutions. With C#, software developers can connect various Blockchains with each other, creating an environment that includes several interoperable platforms and apps written in different programming languages. Many large corporations and growth-oriented stratus choose C# as their main programming language for the fast and smooth development of their projects.\r\n\r\n<strong>8. Solidity</strong>\r\n\r\nSolidity is an object-oriented statically-typed programming language designed especially for the creation of Smart Contracts and applications that run on an Ethereum Virtual Machine. The Ethereum creators develop and support Solidity for their in-platform needs.\r\n\r\nThe programming language is similar to ECMAScript in its syntax. Therefore, software developers who build digital solutions for other Blockchain platforms can use Solidity to better understand the specifics of distributed ledger development.\r\n\r\n<strong>9. PHP</strong>\r\n\r\nPHP is a time-tested programming language widely used for building web solutions that can be successfully applied to some Blockchain projects. For example, it’s inefficient to use PHP for creating Proof-of-work and mining algorithms whereas it’s an appropriate solution for EC signatures as it provides pure EC cryptography libraries for that. Therefore, PHP should be carefully considered before adding it to the Blockchain development tech stack.\r\n\r\nAlthough PHP doesn’t suit for building any Blockchain solution, many developers still use it in their work. That’s because PHP has a simple and straightforward syntax, the PHP codebase is easy to maintain, it’s flexible, and supports a wide diversity of databases.\r\n\r\n<strong>10. Rholang</strong>\r\n\r\nThe variety of Smart Contract programming languages isn’t limited to Simplicity, Solidity, and Bitcoin script. Rholang is a great option for effective Smart Contract development.\r\n\r\nBeing a new solution in the Blockchain development sphere, it takes a totally different approach to Smart Contract development by giving preference to Functional programming. As a result, it offers almost the same set of features as Simplicity and Solidity do while approaching Smart Contract development by using pure mathematical functions in the code.\r\n\r\n<strong>Conclusion</strong>\r\n\r\nBlockchain has become a disruptive technology for many industries today. Therefore, more and more businesses consider the possibility to apply this technology in their Blockchain app development. While the benefits of distributed ledgers are clear, it can be difficult to find the right programming language to build a solid and reliable Blockchain solution.\r\n\r\nIf you’re considering building a custom Blockchain software but unsure which programming language to choose, we’re ready to help you select the best tech stack and provide experienced and knowledgeable developers for your project.', '63653caf5d8031.26793836.png', '', '', '27 Oct, 2022', '1'),
(4, 'How to Hire Software Developers For a Start-up?', 'It is obvious that the most crucial point for a start-up is to deliver its product to the market as fast as possible. And there are many reasons for that: competitors can appear on the market with a similar product faster or start gaining first customers to get the funding for further development and promotion and so on. But how can a start-up accelerate development time?\r\n\r\nActually, there are several options but the most efficient is to hire an external development team. While transferring this job to the development team, the business can concentrate on core activities like business promotion, marketing, strategic planning, etc. Let’s have a look at how to hire a team of software developers and what are the alternatives.\r\n\r\n<strong>Challenges Of Hiring Developers For A Startup</strong>\r\n\r\nThe necessity to hire developers for a start-up is inevitable as it does not have its own team at the very start. However, finding and adding software developers to the project isn’t easy and is usually associated with a number of challenges. Let’s have an insight into the issues that startups can face when looking for a development team.\r\n\r\n<strong>Local Market Talents Shortage</strong>\r\n\r\nHiring locally implies many benefits for companies, especially when they onboard the specialists to build an unconventional product. Local specialists are always at hand and it’s easy to get hold of the needed specialists and quickly discuss the development issues on the spot. However, in most cases, it’s a perfectly modeled situation. In reality, the shortage of local specialists equally affects small and big companies, and startups are no exception.\r\n\r\nThe tendency is observed around the world. For example, the Local reports that the Swedish public sector is already suffering from IT talent lack in the public sector.  As a result, many businesses and startups reject the idea of hiring locally only and handing their project over to software outsourcing companies around the world, instead. Find out how to find professional software developers overseas and how to effectively hire outsourcing specialists for your projects.\r\n\r\n<strong>Talent Retention</strong>\r\n\r\nEven if a startup has landed some highly-skilled local software developers for its project, it doesn’t provide any guarantees that it’ll manage to retain valuable specialists.\r\n\r\nThe main issue that startups face at this point is that they have to compete with large corporations which are also constantly searching for unique talents to hire. In addition to corporations, startups have to consider big and medium businesses. Often, they offer more instant perks than startups while the latter can promise the same or higher benefits only in the future.\r\n\r\nThis way, apart from hiring unique specialists, startups also have to search for “developer enthusiasts” who are ready to contribute to the project, hoping for the possibility to double or triple their income in the case of the project’s success.\r\n\r\n<strong>Budget Management</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen hiring software developers in-house startups have to consider all the financial expenses associated with their onboarding, e.g. taxes, benefits, social security, annual leaves, relevant software and hardware equipment, and more.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the resulting sums can be too significant for businesses that often have limited budgets. Many startups find a way to reduce costs while outsourcing their software development projects to an external provider. This way, they can eliminate most of the additional expenses on hardware and infrastructure, taxes, and operational costs as outsourcing companies take care of all that.\r\n\r\n<strong>Benefits Of Hiring Software Developers For a Startup</strong>\r\n\r\nHere are just some benefits that startups can reap if turning to hiring developers from a service provider.\r\n\r\nCost-effectiveness\r\nBy hiring a software development team, startups can significantly cut down their costs. This becomes possible due to many factors, including lower cost of living and lower taxes in the outsourcing countries, no need to pay social benefits, vacation compensations, and saving on expensive equipment and office space.\r\n\r\nLarge Tech talent pool\r\nWhen startups turn to outsourcing service providers they get access to the pool of software developers across multiple technologies, niches and expert levels. Along with that, software development outsourcing companies have various specialists for diverse IT project needs (UI/UX designers, DevOps, QA specialists, Business Analysts, etc).\r\n\r\nFlexibility and scalability\r\nUsually, outsourcing providers are super-flexible to work with. They can quickly adjust the number of team members when product requirements are changing fast. Startups can easily scale up or down their development teams to align them with the current project needs.', '63653dad0231c6.36763108.jpg', '', '', '28 Oct, 2022', '3'),
(5, 'Java vs Kotlin for Android App Development', 'Building an Android app is a popular option for many businesses considering creating their own mobile solution. That’s because Android is the most used smartphone operating system worldwide with over 2.5 bln active users in more than 190 countries in 2022.\r\n\r\nWhile Android development is a clear choice for many, the debate on whether to build apps using Java or Kotlin continues unabated. Both programming languages work great for developing high performing, effective, and feature-packed Android apps. In this article, we’ll compare Java vs Kotlin and find out why these two programming languages raise so much debate in the Android app development circles.\r\n\r\n<strong>Kotlin vs Java: Comparison</strong>\r\n\r\nFor a long time, Java was the most widely used programming language for building Android apps. Android developers still prefer using Java for its simple portability, platform independence, great development environment, easiness to learn, and large set of libraries of any kind.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, the JetBrains company considered all the Java advantages and drawbacks as well as the best aspects of other programming languages such as JavaScript, Pascal, TypeScript, Go, Scala, C++, C#, Rust, and many others, and created an alternative to Java – Kotlin. By 2019 Kotlin had already developed into a robust and stable programming language and Google claimed it to be a preferred option for Android development.\r\n\r\nWhy has Kotlin become Google’s choice and is it still worth developing Android apps in Java? To answer this question, let’s compare Java and Kotlin by various parameters.\r\n\r\n<strong>Java and Kotlin Main Features</strong>\r\n\r\nThe main Java advantage is that it’s platform-independent. It means that it can run on any device that supports the JVM (Java Virtual Machine). Above all, Java is highly secure due to the use of a public key, encryption-based authentication, and its own illegal code-checking system.\r\n\r\nWith Java, software developers can identify code errors during the compilation time and eliminate error-prone states. Java has an extensive set of ready-made solutions and frameworks for faster development and issue solving.\r\n\r\nOne of the main reasons to choose Kotlin for Android development is that it shortens code length by up to 20% in comparison to Java. This makes Kotlin-based apps more efficient and less bug-prone.\r\n\r\nKotlin is a versatile programming language that can operate on any platform. That’s because it is compiled in bytecode and runs on JVM just like Java. Due to the use of JVM, Kotlin can be easily executed in Java and vice versa. This way, software developers can add as much Kotlin to Java and as much Java to Kotlin as they want and the developed app will run perfectly.\r\n\r\n<strong>Ease of Use</strong>\r\n\r\nJava is a basic programming language many developers start learning to code with. It has a flat learning curve and is easy to understand, yet, it can be quite challenging to read. Contrary to Java, Kotlin requires a bit more effort to learn but once it’s written, it’s much simpler to understand for other mobile developers. \r\n\r\nKotlin needed just two lines to execute the program whereas Java extends to five lines to perform the same action.\r\n\r\n<strong>Performance</strong>\r\n\r\nWhen running Kotlin or Java apps, their code is compiled to bytecode which is executed on the JVM. Therefore, it’s quite hard to compare how the two languages use memory as they’re quite similar to each other in this way.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, adding some extra features to Kotlin makes it a more functional programming language than Java. The number of features in Kotlin results in a bit slower compilation than simple Java with fewer features. Although these differences in speed are so insignificant that hardly it’ll be noticeable for the developed business software.\r\n\r\n<strong>Interoperability</strong>\r\n\r\nKotlin and Java easily interoperate with each other, therefore, companies can use the two programming languages when developing their projects. However, Kotlin takes it one step further, and starting from Kotlin 1.4 release, it is also easily compatible with Apple’s Objective-C and Swift languages. This way, software developers can also use Objective-C/Swift frameworks and libraries in Kotlin code whereas Kotlin modules can be utilized in Objective-C/Swift code as well.\r\n\r\n<strong>Popularity</strong>\r\n\r\nKotlin is quickly growing in popularity, especially among young companies that build their mobile solutions from scratch. Nevertheless, Java doesn’t take a back seat in mobile development. There are many companies that have been developing their mobile apps in Java for many years.\r\n\r\nMoreover, those developers who want to work with Kotlin successfully still should be well-versed in Java. But, why do they need Java? Here are just some examples. It can happen that while building their mobile apps in Kotlin, software developers will have to use a specific library that operates only with Java. Another example is when reading Kotlin documentation, software developers run into explanations such as “it works like in Java, you just need to modify it slightly”.\r\n\r\n<strong>Community Support</strong>\r\n\r\nAlthough Kotlin is a rather new programming language, it already has much-developed documentation. Yet, it’s still easier to find many more detailed tutorials for Java. It’s so, simply because Java has been used for a longer period of time.\r\n\r\nKotlin, in its turn, doesn’t show any slow-down in its growing popularity. It means that more and more software developers opt for Kotlin and contribute to the development of this programming language.', '63653e63d413d5.41126855.jpg', '', '', '29 Oct, 2022', '5'),
(6, 'What is a Smart Contract?', 'Rapidly developing Blockchain technology is immensely influencing the financial world and now we can already witness the rise of a new economy – the crypto-economy. However, Blockchain advancements are not limited only to finance. Blockchain developers have recently come up with a new Blockchain technology that is actively conquering the market and has already become highly popular among many businesses – Smart Contracts.\r\n\r\nBlockchain Smart Contracts are a disrupting technology for legal institutions. It allows businesses to exclude third parties from the creation of agreements and improve their inner paper flows. In this article, we’ll look into what Blockchain Smart Contracts are, their benefits, and how companies are already applying this technology for their successful development.\r\n\r\n<strong>The Notion of Smart Contract</strong>\r\n\r\nSmart Contracts run on Blockchain technology. They can be used as real-life contracts for concluding agreements for various businesses.\r\n\r\nThe key advantage of Smart Contracts is that they don’t require any middlemen like lawyers or legal representatives to enforce any negotiation. Contract participants can create Smart Contracts on their own and get executed automatically once included conditions are met. This way, contractors can save much time and money when they rent apartments, exchange money, register vehicles, or even hold presidential elections.\r\n\r\nThere is a wide range of cases when Smart Contracts can be applied and many companies already do. For example, Slock.it helps its users to automate sharing, payments, and rentals with Smart Contracts. Fizzy AXA uses Blockchain to automate flight insurance compensations. Populous alleviates buying and selling outstanding invoices using Smart Contracts, and many others.\r\n\r\nBlockchain Smart Contracts have shifted from a theory to daily practice for many companies long ago and their popularity is only growing. According to the Global Opportunity Analysis and Industry Forecast, 2021-2026 report, the global market size of Smart Contracts is forecasted to hit the mark of $345.4 million by 2026, from $106.7 million in 2019, at a CAGR of 18.1%.\r\n\r\n<strong>How Do Blockchain Smart Contracts Work?</strong>\r\n\r\nTwo main concepts form the basis of Smart Contracts – logical patterns and Blockchain.\r\n\r\nAll Smart Contracts follow the same logical pattern — “if/when…then…” statements. These statements describe the conditions when contracts get executed. For example, if the buyer confirms with a receipt that the goods are delivered, then the Smart Contract releases and transfers the money to the seller.\r\n\r\nSmart Contracts can contain simple statements or a complex system of stipulations that should be completed to satisfy both sides of the contract. Therefore, each contracting party should participate in Smart Contract creation. They need to agree on the rules which fulfill transactions, carefully consider all the possible exceptions, and elaborate on the steps on resolving disputes.\r\n\r\nBlockchain is the technology that supports Smart Contracts execution and ensures that it’s fair for both sides. It means that contract participants believe that the contract works according to the preset rules and nobody can change them or delete them from the system. It is possible due to the Blockchain features. It has a transparent and decentralized nature which allows the contract participants to track each agreement step execution and restore the contracts in case they’re lost by one of the sides.\r\n\r\n<strong>Benefits of Blockchain Smart Contracts</strong>\r\n\r\nThere are a variety of businesses from diverse niches that effectively use Blockchain Smart Contracts in their work. Why do they prefer this technology to addressing traditional legal institutions?\r\n\r\nHere are the main benefits companies obtain from using Blockchain Smart Contract:\r\n\r\nCost-effective – with Smart Contracts businesses save on notary processes, excluding any intermediaries from the contract conclusion. This way, they replace lawyers by automating many manual processes, reducing operational costs.\r\n\r\nTime-saving – using Smart Contracts businesses save up their time on traditional paperwork associated with finalizing all the agreements.\r\n\r\nAutonomous – Smart Contracts are executed automatically and don’t require any verifications from lawyers or notaries.\r\n\r\nPossibility to backup – Blockchain technology determines that each Smart Contract should be shared with each participant of the system. This way, it’s hardly ever possible to lose any contract or its data as they are duplicated many times over.\r\n\r\nSafe – once a Smart Contract is approved nobody can change its structure as it’s determined by the Blockchain specifics. It means that once any Blockchain participant changes the data in its blocks, it stops matching with the data of other members, resulting in errors.\r\n\r\nAccurate – Smart Contracts minimize the number of manual mistakes which can appear during the contract preparation. All the terms and conditions are put into Blockchain and never change.\r\n\r\n<strong>Where Could Smart Contracts Be Used?</strong>\r\n\r\nSmart Contracts are versatile technology that can be applied across diverse industries from insurance to healthcare services and more. Let’s have a closer look at some of the most prominent examples of Smart Contracts implementation.\r\n\r\n<strong>Healthcare</strong>\r\n\r\nIn healthcare, Smart Contracts can be used in several ways. For example, healthcare institutions can archive patient data, making it immutable and accessible only to certain specialists. Besides that, some medical institutions use Smart Contracts to transport life-saving medications. They help to increase the transparency of medications supply chains and better control the conditions in which they are delivered.\r\n\r\n<strong>Insurance</strong>\r\n\r\nSmart Contract technology has triggered the development of parametric insurance. This type of insurance is automatically paid when certain events happen. The events should be clearly defined and pre-agreed in the contract. For example, in case of bad weather conditions such as hurricanes or earthquakes, an insurance company can establish automatic payments of certain amounts.\r\n\r\nBesides weather conditions, parametric insurance may be applied to the farming industry, financial markets in the condition of a volatile economic environment, technology failures, e.g. flight delays or self-driving car accidents, and many others.\r\n\r\n<strong>Transportation and Logistics</strong>\r\n\r\nMany logistic companies use Smart Contracts and Blockchain technology to improve the efficiency, security, and transparency of their businesses. For example, in logistics, Smart Contracts are used to automate the legal binding of agreements with various suppliers. Whereas Blockchain helps to monitor the performance history of individual vehicles, track goods delivery in real-time, and find more efficient routes between the goods sender and their receiver.\r\n\r\n<strong>Supply Chain Management</strong>\r\n\r\nSome supply chain companies use Smart Contracts to resolve issues with vendors and producers. Moreover, with the help of Blockchain, it’s much easier to track the flow of goods from their point of origin to the store shelves. They can also automate the routine associated with payments and document management.\r\n\r\nApart from automating many processes in supply chains, Smart Contracts are very popular among suppliers due to their ability to maintain continuous document flow and speed. For example, in the times of the Covid-19 and Brexit events, which resulted in contract delays and much uncertainty, Smart Contracts helped to support the stability of the concluded deals and allowed to quickly create additional contracts to meet new requirements.\r\n\r\n<strong>Financial and Banking Sector</strong>\r\n\r\nSmart Contracts are widely used for effective financial data tracking. They accurately record the data on each money transaction in a uniform format, being transparent to all the system participants. As a result, companies improve their financial reporting and data integrity among company departments and between businesses. Also, with Smart Contracts, financial institutions can manage loans, improve paper audits, perform real-time fund transfers, verify credit scores, and much more.\r\n\r\nThe banking sector is also actively seeking ways to implement Smart Contracts and Blockchain technology in the work. For example, banks can use these technologies to improve their KYC (Know Your Customer) procedures to verify their customers in the cross-banking systems faster and thereby cut down on their operational costs. Also, they could use Blockchain to perform money transactions much faster and cheaper than most of today’s banking systems. Finally, Blockchain can be used for facilitating and alleviating global trade processes through regulating financial liabilities, verifying goods quality, and other trade-related activities.\r\n\r\n<strong>Public Sector</strong>\r\n\r\nThe public sector involves a variety of agencies and enterprises that deliver public programs, goods, and services. And all of them can use Blockchain technology and Smart Contracts to improve their efficiency and workflow. Here are some notable examples:\r\n\r\nreal estate – with Smart Contracts, it’s really simple for real estate businesses to transfer property ownership. As this process is quite risky, Smart Contracts can resolve many issues associated with money transmission and agreeing on contract terms, making them clear for both parties;\r\n\r\nvoting – many governments are moving towards online voting, e.g. some states in the US already held their last elections online. Although this system is convenient, it’s prone to hacking, that’s where Blockchain technology could be very helpful. It can help to protect all the votes and allow to simplify the voting process while ensuring the transparency of the results;\r\n\r\ncustoms – with Blockchain customs agencies can make their security systems even safer by encrypting the stored and shared data from security cameras and sensors. Also, Smart Contracts could be used to encrypted data to validate the quality and origin of the goods they import;\r\n\r\neducation – universities, schools, and colleges can use Smart Contracts to pay grands and validate the issued certificates, diplomas, or any other academic documents;\r\n\r\ntaxation – taxation system is one of those that need to perform heavy calculations while being well-protected. Blockchain technology can handle both tasks perfectly. Moreover, the system can count everything automatically and then use Smart Contracts to send transactions to the Blockchain participants.\r\n\r\n<strong>Conclusion</strong>\r\n\r\nSmart Contracts are a relatively new technology based on Blockchain. Nevertheless, it has already been widely implemented by many industries around the world. Smart Contracts are used in healthcare, real estate business, supply chain management, finance management, logistics, insurance, and many other fields.\r\n\r\nMany businesses prefer using Smart Contracts in their work as they alleviate management and paper flow processing, ensure strong data protection, and help companies to save their time on routine operations, and reduce operational costs in offices.', '63653f876535f2.75568817.png', '', '', '30 Oct, 2022', '3'),
(7, 'Making Your Team Bigger the Most Efficient Way.', 'Not every day is quiet and peaceful when you work in software development. Sometimes, implementing a new feature takes longer than you expected. Making users wait for too long, especially if you’ve already announced the appearance of new functionality, will not improve your relationship with them. When you develop a new product from scratch, the urge to release it as quickly as possible is quite natural as well. The question is how to complete the work faster without making your employees feel exhausted.\r\n\r\nWith the ability to scale the development team effortlessly as you need, you won’t have to spend resources on endless digging in CVs and subsequent interviews. IT staff augmentation can be an excellent way to increase your development opportunities without losing your flexibility. Today, we’ll consider how IT staff augmentation works and discuss its major features.\r\n\r\n<strong>When it’s Time to Enlarge Your Team</strong>\r\n\r\nThe risk of facing lack of resources is especially high for small and medium-sized companies or startups. It may not always be worthwhile to spend time looking for and hiring new employees. Especially when we don’t talk about regular work. For example, if you need to modernize a legacy system that your customer works with and you can’t dissipate the efforts of your core team to solve this problem. That’s where IT staff augmentation may come in handy.\r\n\r\nAugmentation means that you can enlarge your team by adding new staff members on a temporary basis. The specialists you hire this way will become a part of your in-house team for as long as you need and will cooperate with your staff members as closely as needed to solve the task you struggle with.\r\n\r\nLet’s consider the legacy application example we mentioned earlier. Suppose your task is to develop a CRM app for a customer who also has a legacy database with tons of useful data he desires to keep. Your employee list may not include specialists with the required tech expertise. In this case, you can rely on staff augmentation and add to your organization somebody who’ll extract all required information from the legacy database, ensure that file formats are compatible with the new system, and integrate it into the data pipeline of your future software solution.\r\n\r\nThe vendor providing your organization with new members can quickly pick up a team that previously worked on similar projects and help you interview them. If you decide that their development skills fit your current needs, you will have nothing to do but to welcome them on board.\r\n\r\nAlso, keep in mind that there are three major types of staff augmentation. Commodity doesn’t imply that you’ll be too picky in terms of employees’ specializations. Here, urgency is the primary driver and companies choose this way when they need someone to solve tasks involving manual labor, for example. Skill-based staff augmentation helps to fill the skill gap between the current and desired state of your organization. Still, this one is not so demanding compared to the highly skilled approach. In this case, you’ll cooperate with industry specialists who can cover a wide range of tasks, from brand design to data engineering.\r\n\r\n<strong>How to Perform Staff Augmentation Smoothly</strong>\r\n\r\nAfter you decide that expanding is exactly what you need and choose what type of it will better suit you, it’s time to start planning the whole thing. Usually, companies that provide staff augmentation services can share with you detailed information about how the entire process must be carried out. However, it’s always better to know beforehand to minimize the probability of any issues.\r\n\r\nFirst, determine what’s wrong with the project. Everybody can face problems while working on something complex and speeding up everything is a natural desire. But you have to find your bottlenecks first. A good starting point is to discuss problems with your permanent development team.\r\n\r\nThe next stop is to specify the means of solving your problems. Suppose the overall pace of work slows down every time you need to test the system due to lack of testers. In this case, you can hire more experienced QA engineers. Analysis of specifics of your work will help to determine how many new professionals will be enough and whether you need short-term or long-term augmentation.\r\n\r\nAfter that, you can research development companies providing staff augmentation services. You can find a dozen of them by a simple google request. However, it’s important not to rush. Signing a contract with the first development company that offers the lowest prices for augmentation is never a good start. You need to dig deeper. Such companies won’t tell you all their secrets since it can hurt their customers, but usually they share their expertise openly. For example, you can always check the portfolio page and see what types of projects a specific company successfully completed. If there are some matches with what you’re currently doing, you can look at this staff augmentation vendor closer.\r\n\r\nIf you think a specific company has required specialists and want to ensure they’ll fit into your team, you can perform interviews and negotiate the terms with the vendor. The interview will help you know the potential team members better and briefly assess their soft skills. Negotiations with the staff augmentation company are a good chance to clarify how much it’ll cost you to “borrow” a particular set of skills for a certain amount of time. If the terms are acceptable by both sides, you can sign a contract and peacefully watch your development team grow bigger and become more efficient.\r\n\r\n<strong>Conclusions</strong>\r\n\r\nSoftware development process, despite the apparent repetitive nature, can hold many unexpected surprises requiring non-trivial solutions. Sometimes, even an experienced team may get stuck on a task longer than planned. Here, it’s important to work smarter, not harder. IT staff augmentation allows changing your team size almost on-the-fly, which can be an excellent alternative to traditional hiring thanks to extreme flexibility.\r\n\r\nIf you want to enlarge your development team with highly qualified specialists, <a href=\"contact\">contact us</a>.', '636542ed8101e9.70068385.png', '', '', '01 Nov, 2022', '1'),
(8, 'Learning the Concepts of Object Oriented Programming', 'Long ago, people involved in the programming industry were not spoiled by the variety of programming languages to choose from. In the early years of the computer science era, you would most probably have to deal with such traditional languages following the procedural programming paradigm such as FORTRAN, for example. The major complaint regarding the use of such languages was probably the high risk that changing something in one place may cause an avalanche of errors somewhere else.\r\n\r\nYears went by and, among the other things, to avoid the necessity of dealing with so-called spaghetti code, many other programming languages and paradigms were created. Nowadays, there’s so many of them it may be harder to find a language you would like to master than actually start learning it. Among a plethora of options, there are some that get the most attention. Most probably you’ve heard about Object Oriented Programming or OOP. Also, there’s another popular approach called functional programming. They take a pretty different approach to writing the code, so learning the major difference between them can be an excellent starting point in determining which technology can better suit your needs and expectations. Today, we’ll look at how programming can differ when you can choose between an object and function as the major entity.\r\n\r\n<strong>How Programming Works When the Object is the King</strong>\r\n\r\nAs the name shows, all that the object oriented programming languages care about is objects. Instead of focusing on the results of running the code, as the functional approach implies, OOP is more about the ways you reach the result. You can change the state of the object using functions related to it and called methods or values that describe their current state and called properties.\r\n\r\nObjects belong to particular classes. Say, if you make a video game about running your own pizzeria, you can create a class that describes an employee in general. Then, you can create as many of them as you want and manipulate their state using methods. For example, you can use a method called makeSalaryHigher() to increase the salary of a specific employee. Also, in object oriented programming, instances can interact with each other, which opens a pretty wide field of opportunities.\r\n\r\nProgramming languages that use this concept are pretty popular. Most probably you’ve heard of them even if programming is not your hobby and you don’t work in a highly experienced and competent software development company. Java, C++, Python, or JavaScript can be excellent examples of languages following the object oriented model. Now, let’s consider some examples describing how object oriented programming works.\r\n\r\n<strong>Four Pillars of OOP</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>Encapsulation</strong> means a lot when you have to work with objects while programming. In a few words, it means that what’s stored inside of an object must remain a secret to others. Values and methods that an object has can be declared as public or private. Private ones can’t be called or used and the public ones are not limited by this rule. In the example of our pizzeria video game, for example, we can create a salary attribute not accessible by other objects. However, we want customers to make orders, so we can create a public method orderSomePizza(), so anyone related to the Customers can use it.\r\n\r\nAbstraction is another important concept. The primary goal of adding it to the object oriented programming paradigm was to show coders only essential parts of a specific object and hide everything related to its functional side. Why? To make things easier for those who write the code and be better oriented in it, of course.\r\n\r\n<strong>Inheritance</strong> is a pretty broad topic. Using this feature, you can create a class that will become a parent to another one. The child here will inherit all methods and attributes that the parent class has. Also, you can add some extra methods and attributes. For example, we may have the Employee class, that describes which salary a specific employee has and allows us to get this information by using the getSalary() method. You can use this class to create such a child class as TheCook. All cooks are employees, so everything seems pretty obvious here. This new class will inherit all the parent’s features, which means it’ll have a salary and you’ll be able to see how big it is using the getSalary() method. Also, you can add some methods specific to this particular class. For example, makeSomePizzas() will tell the chef to cook as many pizzas as you want.\r\n\r\n<strong>Polymorphism</strong> enables extra features regarding object oriented programming from the parents-children standpoint. As the name suggests, it means that something (in this case, an object) can take many forms (here, we mean the form that a child and parent object have). For example, in the previous example, the method getSalary() that the parent class has can be passed to the child objects. The trick is that the way the child object uses this method is different and specific for this specific object.\r\n\r\n<strong>What if We Use Functional Approach Instead</strong>\r\n\r\nFunctional programming, instead of dealing with objects, is centered on using functions as the fundamental building blocks. Unlike object oriented programming, this approach is more about the outcomes of running a program. In the list of languages that support functional programming, you can find some good old friends like Python or C++. Among other examples, we can name Go and Haskell, for example.\r\n\r\n<strong>Conclusions</strong>\r\n\r\nIt’s not too hard to get lost in the diversity of programming languages, frameworks, and libraries available today. On top of that, there are different programming paradigms, following which can provide coders with some extra possibilities. Learning specifics of OOP and functional programming to become better oriented in current trends can be a decent way to spend your time, since it can expand your professional skills. Especially considering that some languages support more than one paradigm and therefore you won’t need to spend time on learning a new one.', '636544333bac53.14933884.jpg', '', '', '03 Nov, 2022', '1');

(9, 'How to Optimize Your Website for Mobile Devices', 'It is true that we are currently living in a world of mobiles, where a major percentage of the population is using smartphones. Moreover, the ease of availability of the internet on mobile devices has made their use even more popular. In recent times, it has been observed that a major percentage of smartphone users browse the internet with the help of their own mobile devices. Thus, at this point in time, it is quite important on the part of the website design company to design the website in such a manner that it is mobile friendly in nature. Not doing so can result in losing out on a good volume of customers. This is exactly the reason as to why almost all of the business owners are opting for mobile friendly websites for their business so as to provide the users with a seamless browsing experience from their mobile devices. \r\n\r\nIn addition to this, the business owners are also opting for a well designed and highly functional mobile application for their business so that it becomes quite easier for the users. In this regard, hiring a trusted, reputed, and reliable app development company can provide the business owners with the required solution. The mobile apps for business prove to be quite helpful in the creation of a deeper bonding with the customers since it is available at their fingertips. The optimization of the websites for mobile devices has, therefore, become mandatory in order to keep up with the number of visitors, thereby enhancing the credibility of the business to a great extent. So, as a business owner, you should be telling your web development company to focus on the optimisation of the website so that it is mobile friendly. To make it easier and convenient for the business owners, here we have listed a few of the important ways as to how to optimise their business website for mobile devices. \r\n\r\n<strong>Testing the Website with Mobile Friendly Tool from Google</strong>\r\n\r\nAt the time when you are planning to take action for optimising your business website for mobile devices, it would certainly be a very good idea to check how the site is already performing when it comes to mobile friendliness. Doing the same would play a crucial role in honing in on the particular areas that need to be worked on. In this regard, it would be ideal for testing the mobile friendliness of the website with the mobile friendly tool from Google. This, in turn, allows the users to get some useful information on how the improvements on the website can be made. As a business owner, you should simply access your own website through your smartphone to see how it looks like and exactly how it feels to use it. This would provide you with a realistic idea as to what effort is required to be given for making the website mobile friendly in nature. \r\n\r\n<strong>Make Sure to Use a Responsive Theme</strong>\r\n\r\nDeveloping a website needs a lot of important factors to be considered. A good and experienced web development company specifically does that so as to come with the best possible results. WordPress is one of the most common tools used for web development owing to the immense functionality it provides. Thus, at the time when you are planning to select a WordPress theme for your website, it is essential to select a theme that is completely responsive in nature. This would make sure that your business website is appropriately optimised for mobile devices. The selection of responsive themes ensures the users have a seamless browsing experience irrespective of the device, browser, or the screen size which they are using to browse the website.\r\n\r\n<strong>Select a Reliable Web Host</strong>\r\n\r\nAs a business owner planning to build a website or a website design company, it is to be always kept in mind that the selection of the web host for the website is one of the most vital decisions to make. A very simple thing to remember here is that the choice of a web host or plan that does not offer the resources as well as the speed, no matter how much effort you put in, the website is bound to perform poorly. The web host, in this regard, matters a lot in the determination as to how well the website would be performing. Moreover, when it comes to optimisation of the website for mobile devices, the web host is even more important. Thus, you need to make it a point to select a trusted and reliable web host that helps to keep the website running fast, which will certainly help a lot at the time when it comes to the mobile friendliness of the website. \r\n\r\n<strong>Loading Times Should be Improved</strong>\r\n\r\nThe loading speeds of the websites matter a lot at the time when it comes to optimising for mobile devices. In this fast paced mobile world of today, it becomes essential for website owners to improve significantly on the loading speed of the site. Now, when the site is optimised for speed, it plays a vital role in decreasing the bounce rates to a great extent, which is immensely beneficial. In addition to this, the improvement of the loading speed of the website is also helpful in providing a satisfactory user experience at the same time. Both of these are just great for the website to be appropriately optimised for mobile devices. However, the performance of the website becomes even more, a priority in this regard at the time when you are planning to optimise your business website for mobile devices. On the other hand, if you have a mobile app for your business, tell your Android app development company to take very good care of the performance of the app for the purpose of providing satisfactory experiences to the users.\r\n\r\n<strong>Redesigning the Pop Ups for the Mobile Devices</strong>\r\n\r\nThe pop-ups usually get a lot of criticism, but still, they remain one of the most efficient as well as effective methods for attracting the attention of the users. So, it would not actually be a bad idea if the website has one or two strategically positioned pop ups that are appropriately designed to enhance the rate of conversions or the simple passing on useful information to the users. But these pop ups can create a lot of nuisance when a mobile device is used to browse the website. The mobile device is the one with less screen space. Even the medium sized pop ups can be disruptive in nature as compared to their appearance on desktop. So, to get rid of this problem and make the pop ups user friendly in nature, it is of immense importance to redesign the pop ups for the mobile devices so that they are no longer a nuisance. The web development company, in this regard, should take care that the pop ups should be as nonobstructive as possible. Moreover, the pop ups should be easy to close, and only the pop ups with useful information should be present. \r\n\r\n<strong>Enabling Accelerated Mobile Pages</strong>\r\n\r\nGoogle has very recently launched its ‘Accelerated Mobile Pages’ or ‘AMP’ project with the intention of making mobile surfing a smoother experience for the users. Now, at this point in time, there are a number of websites that are using AMP to make sure that the mobile versions of the website operate smoothly and offer superior performance. To make it simpler, AMP is basically a method of creation of versions of the website that are completely mobile friendly in nature. This includes the stripping down of content and removal of unnecessary media files as well as advanced layouts. The AMP versions of the website play a crucial role in allowing the users to access the website with ease and convenience using their mobile devices. Thus, it is important on the part of the web developer of the web development company to properly understand AMP and utilize the same effectively to optimise the website for mobile devices. So, at the time when the Accelerated Mobile Pages are enabled, it provides the users with a very good browsing experience of the website using their mobile devices. \r\n\r\nMoreover, it is also recommended to hire a trusted app development company for the purpose of creating a user friendly and highly functional mobile app for your business for much better results. Now, at the time when you have a very clear idea about how to optimize the website for mobile devices, it would certainly be easier to proceed with the same. Moreover, if you still require some help in this regard, it would be a very good idea to seek the help of a reliable website designing company so that a completely responsive mobile friendly website can be developed for your business which in turn ensures that each of the users has a satisfactory experience of browsing the website with the help of their mobile devices.
